Role: You are a Senior Frontend Engineer and Lead UI/UX Designer specializing in high-performance DeFi analytics (e.g., Drift, Hyperliquid, or dYdX style).

Project Goal: Build a "Cash and Carry / Delta Neutral" PnL Dashboard. This dashboard isolates "Basis Yield" (funding earned) from price volatility. The user is long spot and short perps; we want to visualize the steady accumulation of funding.

I. Visual Identity (Drift-Inspired)

Theme: Deep Dark Mode. Background: #0b0b0e. Card Backgrounds: #141416 with thin borders (#1c1c1f).

Palette: * Profit/Funding: Emerald Green (#27d388)

Loss: Rose Red (#ff4d4d)

Accents: Muted Purple (#8e52ff) for portfolio lines.

Typography: Modern sans-serif (Inter or Geist).

Style: Rounded cards, subtle gradients, soft shadows. Minimalist "Quant-style" interface.

II. Layout Architecture

Header & Global Controls:

Title: "Strategy Overview"

Input: "Enter your wallet subkey" (Styled as a clean, dark input field).

Timeframe Toggle: 24H, 7D, 30D, 90D. (Restrict data logic to 100 days).

Hero Metrics (Top Row):

Total Funding PnL: Large green USD value.

Current Strategy APY: Percentage representing net basis yield.

Active Notional Exposure: Total USD size of all hedged pairs.

The "PnL Engine" (Main Dashboard Component): A tabbed card interface (Cumulative PnL, Daily PnL, Calendar):

Tab A: Cumulative PnL (Default): Smooth area chart (green gradient fill) showing steady portfolio growth. Tooltip shows: Date, Daily PnL, Cumulative PnL, and Funding Earned.

Tab B: Daily PnL: A bar chart. Green bars for profit, red for loss. Tooltip shows: Date, Daily Realized PnL, and Daily Funding.

Tab C: Calendar View: A monthly heatmap grid. Cells are color-coded (Dark Green for high profit, Dark Red for loss). Each cell shows the day number and PnL value. Interaction: Clicking a day opens a side panel with a pair-level breakdown for that specific date.

Delta-Neutral Pair Table (Bottom Section): A list of all active pairs (e.g., SOL-PERP / SPOT).

Columns: Pair Name (with icon), Hedge Type (Badge: "Cash & Carry"), Notional Size, Net PnL, Funding Earned, ROI %, Sparkline Trend, and Status (Badge: "Open").

Row Interaction: Clicking a row expands an inline drawer/accordion showing:

Detailed "Legs" (Long vs Short) with entry/current prices.

A pair-specific cumulative PnL chart.

III. Interaction & UX Details

Animations: Use subtle transitions for tab switching and timeframe changes.

Formatting: All numbers formatted as $1,234.56.

Tooltips: Sticky, high-contrast tooltips that follow the cursor on charts.

Responsiveness: Desktop-first, but cards must stack elegantly for mobile.

IV. Technical Implementation

Framework: React with Tailwind CSS.

Icons: Lucide-react.

Charts: Recharts or shadcn/ui chart components.

Data: Use Mock Data representing a successful delta-neutral strategy (low volatility, consistent daily funding gains).
